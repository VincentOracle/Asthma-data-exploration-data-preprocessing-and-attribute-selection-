The analysis of the asthma dataset provides valuable insights into the characteristics and factors associated with asthma cases. This dataset contains various attributes related to individuals' health, demographics, and healthcare utilization. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns, address missing data, and prepare the dataset for further modeling and investigation. We will perform tasks such as data exploration, data preprocessing, and attribute selection to ensure the dataset is suitable for in-depth analysis. This examination will help us better understand the prevalence and impact of asthma in the population.
